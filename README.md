# Cricket-image-captioning
* The primary objective of this project is to develop a model capable of generating descriptive captions for cricket images. When a cricket image is provided as input, the moddel will generate a caption that accurately describes the content and context of the image. By implementing advanced image captioning techniques, we aim to enable the system to understand and interpret the visual elements specific to cricket, such as players, equipment, actions, and the overall game scenario. This project focuses on leveraging image analysis and natural language processing to provide meaningful and informative captions for cricket images.

# About the Dataset
* In this project, We manually collected the cricket images, considering various scenarios such as a bowler in action, boundary ropes, cricket cups, trophies e.t.c. Each image was accompanied by a corresponding manually created caption that accurately describes the specific scenario depicted in the image. This dataset was specifically designed to train the system to generate appropriate captions for cricket-related images, ensuring that it learns the nuances and context of the game. By training the system with this specialized dataset, we aim to develop a cricket image captioning model capable of accurately describing various aspects of the sport in a meaningful and informative manner.

* Dataset will be provided based on the request

# Models
* In this project, two models were employed to achieve the goal of cricket image captioning. The first model utilized is VGG16, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture renowned for its effectiveness in image feature extraction. VGG16 was utilized to extract meaningful and high-level features from the cricket images, capturing essential visual information related to players, equipment, and the overall game scenario.

* The second model employed is LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known for its ability to process sequential data. The LSTM model was responsible for generating descriptive captions based on the extracted image features. By leveraging the sequential nature of natural language, the LSTM model learned to interpret the extracted features and generate coherent and contextually relevant captions for the cricket images.

* By combining the feature extraction capabilities of VGG16 with the sequential processing power of LSTM, this project aimed to create a robust cricket image captioning system that can accurately describe various cricket scenarios based on the visual information in the images.
